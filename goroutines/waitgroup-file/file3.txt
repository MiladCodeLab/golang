The Go programming language was created by Robert Griesemer, Rob Pike, and Ken Thompson at Google in 2007. It was publicly announced in 2009. Go is designed to be simple, concise, and efficient. It has a powerful standard library, and it compiles quickly, making it ideal for large-scale distributed systems.
